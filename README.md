# Design Learning Objects

**Interactive web applications and learning resources for engineering students**

A Master's Engineering project, created to support the Mechanical Engineering course at Imperial College London. The goal was to utilise front end technologies to improve the understanding of certain engineering topics by providing students with interactive learning tools and visual demonstrations.
